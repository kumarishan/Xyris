xyris-classifier
=====================

okay this requires you to install following gems

phrasie
bishop
yaml
anemone
open-uri

there are three parts in the code
the current uncommented part uses phrasie to extract imp words from wikipedia articles 

To test Bayesin classsfier
comment out the term extraction section(which is uncommented part now) and then uncomment the last secition ie
after and including the line

classify = Bishop::Bayes::new { |probs,ignore| Bishop::robinson(probs.......

it wil use the already trained and stored file of bayes classifier. the stored data is in bayesdata,yml which it automatically picks.

I trained by crawling string theroy wikipedia article till depth 1 and I am tryign to classify the same...
u can try classifying other by chanign the url in the link in Anemone.cralw("...") of the last secion
